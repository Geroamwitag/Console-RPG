1- create a proper level system
    - before a level the player can edit their attacks using attacks from their attacks inventory (done)
    - before a battle begins, the console will hint at the enemies weaknesses
    - during the players turn in the level, the player can select from a list of attacks which will have varying effects 
    - after an enemy is defeated the level will follow onto the next enemy after rewarding exp for defeating the prior enemy (done)
    - when the boss is defeated the level will be marked as completed and the player will be rewarded with:
        - exp
        - item drops
        - may learn a new type of attack
    - save the characters data before exiting the level (done)

2- create a proper leveling system
    - the character will be given a level property
    - this level will increase after the exp property reaches a certian property
    - leveling up will require more exp as the player levels, perhaps by multiplying a required exp to level property for the character
    - the player will be rewarded 1 sp per level which can be allocated to a stat
    - the player may be rewarded new attacks
 
3- create a variety of weapons and attacks (optional since this is just practice)
